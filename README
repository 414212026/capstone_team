Project Overview
This project focuses on stock prediction using various models, including LSTM, ARIMA, and hybrid approaches such as LSTM-XGBoost. The analysis incorporates sentiment data and economic indicators to improve forecasting accuracy.

Components
README File: This document provides instructions on how to set up and run the project.
Requirements File: A requirements.txt file lists all the libraries required to execute the code.
Code: Scripts to generate predictions, results, and figures for the reports.
Cleaned Code: Cleaned and optimized code with unused blocks removed, relative file paths used, and sensitive information (like API keys) excluded.
Data Access Statement: Detailed instructions for obtaining data via APIs. Licenses and terms of use for data providers are respected.

How to Run the Project
1. Set Up Environment
Clone the repository or download the project files.
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system.
Install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Obtain API Keys
See Data Access Statement in the details.

3. Run Code
Refer to the cleaned code folderwhich follow a naming convention indicating their execution sequence. 
The first two characters in the file names specify the order in which the files should be executed.

3.1 Data Preparation:
File: 01_final_1_voo_1_data_prepared.py
Purpose: Fetch and preprocess the necessary data, including economic and sentiment data.
Command to run: python 01_final_1_voo_1_data_prepared.py
Outputs: Cleaned datasets saved in the data/ directory.

3.2 Model Training and Evaluation:
File: 02_final_voo_train_models.py
Purpose: Train LSTM, ARIMA, and hybrid models (e.g., LSTM-XGBoost).
Command to run: python 02_final_voo_train_models.py
Outputs: Trained models saved in the models/ directory and Evaluation metrics logged.

3.3 Results and Visualization:
File: 03_final_voo_results_analysis.py
Purpose: Generate predictions, calculate metrics (e.g., MSE, R²), and create figures.
Command to run: python 03_final_voo_results_analysis.py
Outputs: Predictions saved as CSV files in the results/ directory and Plots and figures saved in the figures/ directory.

4. Output
Predictions and evaluation metrics (e.g., MSE, R², Sharpe Ratio) are saved as CSV files.
Figures are generated and saved in the figures directory.
