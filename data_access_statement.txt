Our project utilizes two datasets obtained via APIs, with proper respect for data ownership and licensing:

Economic Data:
This dataset includes variables such as interest rates, employment statistics, and other macroeconomic indicators. It is sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API. Access requires a free API key, which can be obtained by registering at:
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html.
FRED data usage is subject to their terms of service, and the API key allows free access to this publicly available economic data.

Sentiment Data:
This dataset contains daily sentiment scores derived from news articles for individual stock tickers. It is accessed via the Alpha Vantage API. Users need to apply for a free API key at:
https://www.alphavantage.co/query.
Alpha Vantage provides free tier access to sentiment data under their API usage policy, which must be adhered to when using or redistributing the data.

Both APIs are free to use with the respective API keys, and all data usage complies with the licensing terms of the providers.
